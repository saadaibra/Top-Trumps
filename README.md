# Top-Trumps
Certainly! The game created in this Python script is inspired by the popular "Top Trumps" card game, but with a Pokémon twist. Players start by launching the game, where they receive a warm welcome and an overview of the goal: to collect all the Pokémon cards from the deck by outperforming the computer in rounds. Each round begins with both the player and the computer receiving a random Pokémon fetched from an online Pokémon database.

In each round, players choose a specific attribute—like height, ID number, or weight—on which their Pokémon will compete against the computer's. The game then compares these attributes between the two Pokémon, determining whether the player wins, loses, or if it's a draw. This process repeats over several rounds, keeping track of wins and losses until a set number of rounds (typically 5) have been completed. The player with the most round victories at the end is declared the winner of the game. It's a fun and interactive way to engage with Pokémon data and enjoy strategic gameplay based on statistical comparisons.
